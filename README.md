# singapore_resale_flate_pricing

**Introduction** : This project aims to construct a machine learning model and implement it as a user-friendly online application in order to provide accurate predictions about the resale values of apartments in Singapore. This prediction model will be based on past transactions involving resale flats, and its goal is to aid both future buyers and sellers in evaluating the worth of a flat after it has been previously resold. Resale prices are influenced by a wide variety of criteria, including location, the kind of apartment, the total square footage, and the length of the lease. The provision of customers with an expected resale price based on these criteria is one of the ways in which a predictive model may assist in the overcoming of these obstacles.
